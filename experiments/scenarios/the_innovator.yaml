    - "One explorer (likely Agent 0) trying unusual movement patterns"
    - "Higher survival rate for the innovator"
    - "Other agents observing and imitating successful moves (tick 150+)"
    - "New 'meme' spreading through the population"
    - "Population-wide shift in behavior by tick 300+"
  narrative: "Innovation doesn't require genius—just desperate exploration. One agent stumbles onto a better way. Others are watching. Not through instruction, but through imitation and cultural osmosis, a new way of being spreads like a virus through the population. Memes are real."
