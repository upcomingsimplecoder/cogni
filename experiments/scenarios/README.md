# AUTOCOG Playground Scenarios

Welcome to AUTOCOG's Explorable Scenarios. These are 7 carefully designed situations that showcase different cognitive phenomena in action. Pick one, hit play, and watch how simple agents with sophisticated minds create complex social worlds.

**What you're watching**: 10-20 agents navigating a survival world. They have hunger, thirst, and energy. They can communicate, cooperate, betray, and learn. Some think fast (System 1: gut instinct). Some think slow (System 2: careful analysis). Some are natural diplomats. Others are aggressors. Over time, they develop languages, cultures, and alliances.

Each scenario is designed to teach you something different.

## The Betrayal

**Setup**: In this scenario, 5 agents are placed in a compact 20×20 world. Among them: four cooperative types (diplomats and gatherers) and one aggressor hiding in plain sight. Resources are moderate. Space is tight.

**What to Watch**:

1. Switch to the **Social Lens** (press `2` in the visualization)
2. In the early game (tick 30-80), notice the white trust links forming between agents. These aren't programmed—they emerge from Theory of Mind modeling. The agents are building models of each other's intentions.
3. The diplomats are optimistic. They assume others are mostly cooperative.
4. Then, around tick 80-120, something breaks. The aggressor, hungry and desperate, strikes.
5. Watch how the surviving agents reorganize. Do they rebuild trust? Form defensive pacts? Or does society collapse into paranoia?

**Why It Matters**: This demonstrates how Theory of Mind works—and how fragile it is. Agents build mental models of each other based on observed behavior. These models feel real, feel reliable. Then one betrayal reveals that the map was wrong. The territory (reality) wasn't what the agents thought.

This is the fundamental human tragedy: we can't know if someone is trustworthy until they prove otherwise, and by then, sometimes it's too late.

**Suggested Lenses**:
- **Social** (key 2): Watch trust links form and shatter
- **Spatial** (key 1): Notice how betrayal reshuffles the population

**Key Moments**:
- **Tick ~50**: Trust network is densest. The false peace is beautiful.
- **Tick ~80-120**: The betrayal. Rewatch this moment frame-by-frame to see the breakdown.
- **Tick ~150+**: Survivors either rebuild cautiously or descend into conflict.

## Overconfidence

**Setup**: 5 agents, 400 ticks, a 28×28 world. All of them have **dual-process thinking** enabled—they can think fast (System 1) or think slow (System 2). They also have **metacognition**: the ability to think about their own thinking. When their confidence is shattered enough, they *notice* it, and switch gears.

**What to Watch**:

1. Switch to the **Cognition Lens** (press `3` in the visualization)
2. Early game (tick 0-100): Agents are *supremely* confident. They snap decisions in milliseconds. System 1 thinking is fast and often right, so they coast.
3. But System 1 is also overconfident. It makes mistakes without realizing it.
4. Around tick 80-150: Failures pile up. The agents' confidence meter drops. Something shifts internally—they *feel* uncertain.
5. When the doubt reaches a threshold, the agents switch to System 2 thinking. Now they pause. They consider. They reason more carefully.
6. Around tick 250+: You'll see the effect. Agents are slower to act, but their survival rate improves. Fewer mistakes. Better planning.

**Why It Matters**: Your brain does this constantly. When you're confident you know the answer, you think fast. Snap decisions, minimal effort. But when you realize "wait, I'm not sure," you slow down. You deliberate. You pay more attention.

This scenario shows that **thinking style is a choice**, and the choice depends on your confidence. Agents who are overconfident die. Agents who learn to doubt survive.

**Suggested Lenses**:
- **Cognition** (key 3): Watch the System 1 → System 2 transitions
- **Spatial** (key 1): Notice survival differences between fast/slow thinkers

**Key Moments**:
- **Tick ~50-100**: Peak overconfidence. Quick wins. Shallow thinking.
- **Tick ~120-150**: First metacognitive crises. Agents realizing they were wrong.
- **Tick ~200+**: System 2 behavior is stable. Better outcomes.

## Babel

**Setup**: 8 agents in a 40×20 world divided by geography. They're separated at the start, with the left half and right half far apart. The world has **emergent language** enabled—agents can invent symbols and build grounded meanings (associations between symbols and things in the world).

**What to Watch**:

1. Switch to the **Language Lens** (press `4` in the visualization—if available)
2. For the first 100-200 ticks, each group innovates independently. The left group creates symbols that work for *them*. The right group creates symbols that work for *them*.
3. Neither group knows what the other is doing. They're inventing language in parallel.
4. Around tick 250-300, the barrier disappears. Agents from the left meet agents from the right.
5. **Linguistic collision**: The left group is saying one thing (using their symbols). The right group is saying something else (using their own symbols). They're speaking past each other.
6. What happens next? Do they:
   - Learn each other's language (slow, requires patience)
   - Merge and create a new shared language
   - Refuse to communicate and separate again
   - Something stranger?

**Why It Matters**: This is how language divergence works in the real world. Separate groups develop different dialects, different meanings for the same words, different ways of seeing the world. When they collide, they have to negotiate a shared reality. Sometimes they do. Sometimes they don't.

You can watch the birth of a language family, the collision of cultures, and the messy process of linguistic integration—all in 500 ticks.

**Suggested Lenses**:
- **Language** (key 4): Watch symbol innovation and convention formation
- **Social** (key 2): Notice how language affects coalition formation

**Key Moments**:
- **Tick ~100-150**: Left group conventions solidify around first symbol set
- **Tick ~100-150**: Right group invents completely different symbols
- **Tick ~250-300**: Groups collide—communication crisis!
- **Tick ~350+**: Convergence or divergence?

## The Innovator

**Setup**: 8 agents in a 32×32 world. Multiple archetypes: explorers (2), gatherers (2), diplomats (2), survivalists (2). **Evolution** and **cultural transmission** are both enabled. This means agents can evolve slightly different behaviors, *and* other agents can observe and imitate those behaviors. Winning strategies spread like memes.

**What to Watch**:

1. Switch to the **Cultural Lens** (press `5` in the visualization—if available)
2. One agent—probably an explorer—will stumble onto an unconventional strategy. Maybe they forage in a spiral pattern. Maybe they approach resources differently. Maybe they communicate more or less.
3. This strategy works *better* than the default. The innovator survives longer, gets more resources, prospers.
4. Around tick 100-150: Other agents are watching. They see success and they imitate it. Not through instruction, but through observation and cultural adoption.
5. Around tick 200+: The strategy is spreading. Half the population is now using the innovator's trick.
6. By tick 300+: It's mainstream. The entire population has shifted their behavior. A cultural meme has taken over.

**Why It Matters**: This is how evolution works at the cultural level. You don't need genetic inheritance. You just need observation and imitation. A better idea spreads because people see it working. It's why you adopted your favorite cooking technique (you watched someone do it, it looked good, you tried it). It's how fashion spreads. It's how prejudices persist.

Watch a meme propagate in real time.

**Suggested Lenses**:
- **Cultural** (key 5): Watch the adoption cascade
- **Spatial** (key 1): See how the innovation spreads geographically

**Key Moments**:
- **Tick ~80-100**: Innovator experiments with unusual strategies
- **Tick ~120-180**: First adoption events—others notice and imitate
- **Tick ~200-300**: Rapid spread—the meme is contagious
- **Tick ~350+**: New baseline behavior is established

## Coalition Wars

**Setup**: 10 agents (5 pairs: aggressor+diplomat, explorer+gatherer, survivalist+another) in a large 40×40 world with sparse resources. **Theory of Mind** and **coalitions** are enabled. Agents build mental models of each other, and naturally form alliances based on those models.

**What to Watch**:

1. Switch to the **Coalition Lens** (press `6` in the visualization—if available)
2. Early game (tick 0-80): Agents are scattered, independent. But they start noticing each other. A diplomat sees that another diplomat shares goals. An aggressor notices potential allies.
3. Around tick 50-100: Natural coalitions crystallize. You'll see colored groups form on the map. Not random—they emerge from agents recognizing compatible goals and Theory of Mind models.
4. Around tick 150-200: First inter-coalition conflict. Resources are scarce. Coalitions compete. Skirmishes break out.
5. Around tick 250-350: Either a dominant coalition emerges, or the system balances into an uneasy stalemate.

**Why It Matters**: Coalitions are how complex societies form. You don't need a central planner assigning people to teams. People naturally cluster with others who share their goals and have compatible worldviews. Competition between coalitions creates politics, war, alliances, and betrayal.

This scenario shows the emergence of geopolitics from simple individual agents.

**Suggested Lenses**:
- **Coalition** (key 6): Watch teams form and compete
- **Social** (key 2): Notice diplomatic links between factions
- **Spatial** (key 1): Track territorial consolidation

**Key Moments**:
- **Tick ~80-120**: Coalition formation. Watch colored groups crystallize.
- **Tick ~150-200**: First coalition war. Resources become flash points.
- **Tick ~300+**: Winner emerges, or stalemate locks in.

## The Philosopher

**Setup**: 5 agents, 300 ticks, a 28×28 world with **dual-process thinking** and **metacognition** fully enabled. This is a focused exploration of *cognition itself*—how agents choose between fast and slow thinking.

**What to Watch**:

1. Switch to the **Cognition Lens** (press `3` in the visualization)
2. In the first 50 ticks: Agents are making snap decisions. System 1 is fast and feels good. They rely on intuition, heuristics, gut feel. It works most of the time.
3. Around tick 50-100: System 1 starts failing in subtle ways. An agent misjudges a distance. Another forgets to account for energy costs. Small failures, but they pile up.
4. Around tick 100-150: Agents begin to notice their uncertainty. Not consciously, but through metacognition—they become aware that their confidence is dropping.
5. Around tick 150-200: System 2 kicks in more frequently. Agents slow down. They deliberate. They plan multiple steps ahead. They make fewer mistakes, but act more slowly.
6. Around tick 250+: A rhythm emerges. Agents switch between fast and slow thinking fluidly, depending on context.

**Why It Matters**: This is the core of dual-process theory, made visible. System 1 (fast) is your gut, your intuition, your pattern-matching brain. System 2 (slow) is your conscious reasoning, your mathematician brain. Neither is "better"—they're designed to work together. System 1 handles routine, low-stakes decisions. System 2 handles novel, high-stakes decisions.

When you're confident, you think fast. When you're uncertain, you think slow. And the switch happens automatically, through metacognition—thinking about your own thinking.

This scenario is a masterclass in how your mind works.

**Suggested Lenses**:
- **Cognition** (key 3): Watch the System 1 ↔ System 2 dance
- **Spatial** (key 1): Notice how thinking style affects movement and decision-making

**Key Moments**:
- **Tick ~20-80**: System 1 dominance. Fast, intuitive, confident.
- **Tick ~80-120**: System 1 errors accumulate. Doubt emerges.
- **Tick ~150-200**: System 2 engagement increases. Slower but more accurate.
- **Tick ~250+**: Fluid switching. The optimal rhythm.

## Emergence

**Setup**: 10 agents in a 36×36 world with **everything enabled**: Theory of Mind, metacognition, evolution, cultural transmission, emergent language, and coalitions. This is the full cognitive stack.

**What to Watch**:

This is complex. Don't try to follow everything at once. Instead, pick a few threads and follow them:

1. **Thread 1 — Language** (Lens 4):
   - Around tick 80-150: Agents start innovating symbols
   - Around tick 150-250: Conventions solidify into stable language
   - Around tick 250+: Language is used strategically in coalitions

2. **Thread 2 — Coalitions** (Lens 6):
   - Around tick 50-100: Agents recognize compatible goals, form teams
   - Around tick 150-250: Coalitions develop internal culture (shared language variants)
   - Around tick 300+: Coalitions may have distinct "dialects"

3. **Thread 3 — Culture** (Lens 5):
   - Around tick 100-150: Innovations emerge independently
   - Around tick 150-300: Winning strategies spread through observation and imitation
   - Around tick 300+: Population-wide behavior shift

4. **Thread 4 — Cognition** (Lens 3):
   - Throughout: Agents switching between System 1 and System 2
   - High-stakes moments (threats, conflicts) trigger more deliberation
   - Routine moments allow fast thinking

5. **Thread 5 — Society** (Lens 2):
   - At tick 0-100: Trust networks form, betrayals occur
   - At tick 150-250: Social hierarchies emerge
   - At tick 300+: Stable or unstable social order

**Why It Matters**: This scenario demonstrates **emergence**—the principle that complex patterns arise from simple rules, interactions, and feedback loops. No single agent is "programming" a language, culture, or coalition structure. These things bubble up from local interactions.

It's what makes complex societies work. It's also what makes them fragile, unpredictable, and fascinating.

Watch how many layers of complexity can spontaneously organize from basic agents and simple rules.

**Suggested Lenses**:
- **Multi-view**: Watch all lenses cycle through, or focus on one for deep dives

**Key Moments**:
- **Tick ~100**: Early coalitions and language innovation
- **Tick ~200**: Language conventions solidify, cultural memes spread
- **Tick ~300**: Complex social hierarchies apparent
- **Tick ~400+**: Stable society structure (or breakdown)

## The Lenses Explained

- **Lens 1 — Spatial**: Where are agents? What resources are left? What's the geography of the situation?
- **Lens 2 — Social**: Who trusts whom? Who's cooperating? Who's fighting? What's the social network?
- **Lens 3 — Cognition**: Is this agent using System 1 (fast) or System 2 (slow)? What's their confidence level?
- **Lens 4 — Language**: What symbols are agents using? Which conventions have solidified? How's communication going?
- **Lens 5 — Cultural**: Which behavioral variants are spreading? Who's imitating whom? What's the meme landscape?
- **Lens 6 — Coalition**: Which agents are grouped together? What's the coalition structure? Who's competing?

## Tips for Deep Watching

- **Rewatch key moments**: Pause, back up, watch again. Emergence is subtle.
- **Compare scenarios**: Run multiple scenarios in sequence. How does language emerge differently in "Babel" vs "Emergence"?
- **Vary the seed**: Same scenario, different seed = different outcome. Run it 3-5 times and see the range of possibilities.
- **Focus on one agent**: Pick an agent and track their journey from tick 0 to 500. What decisions did they make? Did they survive? Why or why not?
- **Look for phase transitions**: Moments where the system shifts from one mode to another. These are where emergence happens.

## A Note on Interpretation

These scenarios are **not predictions**. They're **demonstrations**. They show what *can* happen when you wire up these cognitive mechanisms. Whether these specific patterns occur in humans depends on context, culture, and a thousand other factors.

Think of them as thought experiments made visible. "What would society look like if agents had Theory of Mind? If they had metacognition? If cultural transmission was the only way to spread winning strategies?"

The scenarios are the answer.
