    - "Coalition formation based on theory of mind models"
    - "Cultural memes spreading through populations"
    - "Switch between System 1 and System 2 thinking"

    - "Cross-coalition diplomatic incidents"
    - "Linguistic divergence within coalitions"
  narrative: "This is the full symphony. All the cognitive instruments are playing: Theory of Mind reads intentions, metacognition governs when to think fast or slow, culture spreads winning strategies like wildfire, language evolves to encode shared meaning, and coalitions form around shared identity. Watch how many layers of complexity can simultaneously emerge from simple agents and simple rules."
