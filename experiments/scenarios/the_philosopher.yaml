  watch_for:
    - "Snap decisions dominating early game (System 1 - intuitive, fast)"
    - "System 1 errors: failed predictions, wasted energy"
    - "Agents shifting to System 2 when they realize they don't know something"
    - "System 2 behavior: longer deliberation, fewer mistakes"
    - "The rhythm of thinking: fast reflexes when confident, slow reflection when uncertain"
  narrative: "Your brain is two brains. One is a chess grandmaster, making moves in milliseconds. The other is a meticulous accountant, weighing every factor. Agents have both. Watch them dance between snap judgments and deep deliberation. Neither thinking style is bad—they're just good at different things."
