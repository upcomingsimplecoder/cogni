  watch_for:
    - "Quick, intuitive decisions dominating early (System 1)"
    - "Repeated failures triggering doubt signals"
    - "Transition to slower, more careful thinking (System 2)"
    - "Improved survival outcomes after shift"
  narrative: "Confidence is a superpower—until it isn't. Watch agents trapped in fast-thinking loops, making snap decisions with incomplete information. When their overconfidence meter hits critical, something clicks: they pause, they think deeply, they survive."
