# Example Experiment: Cognitive Architecture Comparison
#
# This experiment compares how different cognitive architectures perform
# in the same environment, testing their decision-making and survival strategies.

name: "Architecture Comparison Study"
description: |
  Compares reactive, social, and dual_process architectures across survival,
  cognitive, and social metrics to understand architecture tradeoffs.

# Expected outcomes:
# - Reactive: Faster decisions, higher aggression, lower cooperation_ratio
# - Social: Highest cooperation_ratio and trust_network_density, more coalitions
# - Dual_process: Best survival_rate and calibration_score (balanced approach)
# - Reactive may show highest emergence_event_count (more exploratory)
