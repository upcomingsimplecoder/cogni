# Example Experiment: Personality Trait Evolution
#
# This experiment studies how starting personality traits shape agent behavior
# over time and whether traits converge or diverge through social learning.

name: "Trait Evolution Study"
description: |
  Examines how different starting personality configurations (high-aggression,
  high-cooperation, balanced) evolve over extended simulation time.

# Expected outcomes:
# - High_aggression: Lower survival_rate, fewer coalitions, high emergence_diversity
# - High_cooperation: Highest coalition_count and trust_network_density
# - Balanced_traits: Best overall survival_rate and cultural_diversity
# - Cultural transmission may shift traits toward cooperation over time (all conditions)
