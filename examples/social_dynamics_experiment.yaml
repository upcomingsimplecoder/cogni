# Example Experiment: Social Dynamics and Cultural Evolution
#
# This experiment demonstrates the new metrics by comparing three
# conditions with different cooperation tendencies.

name: "Social Dynamics Study"
description: |
  Investigates how cooperation tendency affects social structures,
  cultural transmission, and cognitive development.
